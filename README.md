# Codewars
I have been doing Codewars problems for a while but i've decided to start putting my solutions on GitHub just to have more code examples online.

## Update
I've switched to using leetcode for now.

### Format
Each solution file is named after the name of the Codewars problem that file solves (with respect to the language used's file naming conventions) and **the first line includes a comment of a link to the problem.**
