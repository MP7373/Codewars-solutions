# Codewars
I have been doing Codewars problems for a while but i've decided to start
putting my solutions on GitHub just to have more code examples online.

I'm not going to go through all of my past solutions and adding them to this repo but intend to add all of the problems I do on Codewars here from now on.

### Format
Each solution file is named after the name of the Codewars problem that file solves and the first line includes a comment of a link to the problem.
