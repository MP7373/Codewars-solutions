You see a wall, and there's 99 bottles of beer on it! There also happens to be
2 or more people near you (that means you can pass it around!) so what do you
do?

Then what do you do?

Write a function called 'takeOneDownAndPassItAround' that takes one argument
called 'numberOfPeopleNearYou' which represents the number of people near you
not including yourself.

```javascript
const takeOneDownAndPassItAround = function(numberOfPeopleNearYou) {

}
```

If there is ever less than 2 other people near you your function should return:

```javascript
  'Not enough people to pass it around, find more people.'
```
(Sharing with 1 other person is passing back and forth, not around.)

This function should return the number of bottles of beer left on the
wall after you take one down and pass it around (that means one less than was
there before the function was called).

The wall starts with 99 bottles of beer on it so:

```javascript
  takeOneDownAndPassItAround(6)
```
Should return 98

If the function is called consecutive times than it must return 1 less than the
previous call each time it is called until there are no bottles of beer left on
the wall.

If there are no bottles of beer left on the wall your function should return:
```javascript
  'Find another wall.'
```

Happy Coding!
