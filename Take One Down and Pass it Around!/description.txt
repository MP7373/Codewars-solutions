You see a wall, and there's 99 bottles of beer on it! There also happens to be
greater than or equal to two (<= 2) people near you (that means you can pass it
around!) so what do you do?

Then what do you do?

Write a function called 'takeOneDownAndPassItAround' that takes one argument
called 'numberOfPeopleNearYou':

```javascript
const takeOneDownAndPassItAround = function(numberOfPeopleNearYou) {

}
```

This function should return the number of bottles of beer left on the
wall after you take one down and pass it around (that means one less than was
there before the function was called).

The wall starts with 99 bottles of beer on it so:

```javascript
  takeOneDownAndPassItAround(6)
  //should return 98
```

If the function is called consecutive times than it must return 1 less than the
previous call each time it is called until there are no bottles of beer left on
the wall.

If there are no bottles of beer on the wall your function should return:
```javascript
  'Find another wall.'
```

If there is ever less than 2 people around you your function should return:
```javascript
  'Not enough people to pass it around, find more people."
```

Happy Coding!
